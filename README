# lein-log4c

This leingingen plugin allows you to configure log4j log levels
dynamically from the environment *without* requiring any production
dependency on log4j in your code. This approach is ideally suited for
library developers who don't want to impose a logging solution on
their library's clients.

Log levels are configured by namespace.

## Usage

CLJ_LOG_LEVEL=:warn,mylib.myns:debug lein midje

The above will set the root logger to have a log level of WARN and the
mylib.myns namespace logger to have a level of DEBUG during the
execution of lein midje.  To configure more static log4j options,
consider placing a log4j.properties file in your test-resources
directory.

Note that your project must declare test dependencies as follows:

  :dev-dependencies [...
                     [org.slf4j/slf4j-api "1.6.4"]
                     [org.slf4j/jcl-over-slf4j "1.6.4"]
                     [org.slf4j/slf4j-log4j12 "1.6.4"]
                     [log4j/log4j "1.2.16"]
                     ...]
